## SUCD Project##
This project is designed as an collection of the most recent community detection algorithms. Thanks for the contribution of :

- Lovingmage(Algorithm design & implementation) 
- TQJADE(algorithm optimization)
- hoduan(Experimental studies & algorithm validation)
- raven47zrq(program debug & testing)
- bollakarthikeya(Dataset preprocessing)

File structure
--------------

> **Basic Codes** : This file contains all the basic community detection scripts

> **Datasets** : This file contains some popular network files which may used in the future  works.

> **KcorePeng14Arxiv** : This file contains the implementatiopn of Peng's paper on Kcore decomposion for speedup community detection

> ** Spectral** : This part is the code, used for the research on speedup community detection works by using hardware simulation

Spectral
------------
The file currently contains two scripts which highly rely on matrix eigenvalues and eigenvectors. One is spectral clustering method and another is principle component analysis.
