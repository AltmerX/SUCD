## 0x01 Introduction ##
Accelerating Community Detection by Using K-core Subgraphs is proposed by Peng et.al. in Arxiv 2014 [1], and have been proved by the author that it is indeed a good method to boost community detection process. We will try to re-perform the community detection process by using their method.

## 0x02 Environment and Implementation Platform ##
The necessary toolkit and packages required in our implementation are listed as follows.

* Python 2.7.x
* Networkx 1.9.19 (Do not use the latest version.)
* python-louvain
* Matplotlib

Use can firstly install python and using python pip toolkit to install the remain toolkits. Please do not use python 3.3 or above version, and do not install networkx version other than 1.9.19. Please be aware that the Networkx 1.10.x have some bugs remain unsolved.
